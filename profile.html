					Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port Huron, Michigan,
					after the family moved there in 1854.[8] He was the seventh and last child of
					Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and
					Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871, born in Chenango County, New York).[9][10] His patrilineal
					family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey;[11] the surname had originally been "Edeson".[12]
					
					His great-grandfather, loyalist John Edeson, fled New Jersey for Nova Scotia in 1784. The family moved
					to Middlesex County, Upper Canada around 1811, and his grandfather, Capt. Samuel Edison Sr. served with the 1st
					Middlesex Militia during the War of 1812. His father, Samuel Edison Jr. moved to Vienna, Ontario, and fled to Ohio
					after his involvement in the Rebellion of 1837.[13]
					
					Edison was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, who used to be a school teacher. He attended school
					for only a few months. However, one biographer described him as a very curious child who learned most things by reading
					on his own.[14] As a child, he became fascinated with technology and spent hours working on experiments at home.[15]
					
					Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever
					during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about
					the cause of his deafness.[16] He was completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other. It is alleged[17] that Edison
					would listen to a music player or piano by clamping his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull. As he got
					older, Edison believed his hearing loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work. Modern-day
					historians and medical professionals have suggested he may have had ADHD.[15]
